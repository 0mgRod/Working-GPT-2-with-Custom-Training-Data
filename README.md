### Before using:

+ Before using this, make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your computer.
+ Then, once you are in the installation wizard, make sure you add Python to PATH on it.

### After Installing Python:

Open the Command Prompt and paste the following in it.

```
pip install transformers pandas numpy
```

Now, you are technically ready to run the code. What you need to do now is unzip the zip file and create a `results` folder. Lastly, enter whatever information you want your GPT-2 model to know about in the `data.txt` file.
